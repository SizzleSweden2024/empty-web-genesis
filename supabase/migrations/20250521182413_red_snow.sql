  # Update poll_responses RLS policy

  1. Changes
    - Fix the INSERT policy for poll_responses table to allow anonymous submissions
    - Make the poll_responses SELECT policy more permissive to allow viewing all responses
    - These changes enable survey functionality while maintaining appropriate security

  2. Security
    - Allows users to submit responses with their local user ID
    - Allows viewing poll responses aggregated data for results
